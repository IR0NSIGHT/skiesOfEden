Suggested changes to bar exchange:
- use bronze to buy metal mesh and crystal composite (asked players if they prefer mesh+composite or components, they wanted mesh+comp)
Suggested addition to bar exchange:
- use silver to buy bigger amount + 5% extra of bronze offers (buying bigger gives a discount):
	- example: 1 bronze = 100k metal mesh, -> 5 bronze = 1 silver = 5*100k + 10% extra metal mesh = 550k metal mesh
