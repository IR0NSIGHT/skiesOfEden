General reules:
	- Be polite to eachother in chat.
	- Keep chat clear of spam.
	- If someone is impolite, that does not give you the right to be disrespectful.

Ingame rules:
- Players:
	- Do not abuse gamebugs or glitches to give yourself an advantage.
	- Combat is allowed and encouraged. Bullying is not. If someone has lost and can't fight back anymore, leave them alone.
	- Do not play in such a way, that it severly impacts the fun of everyone else.
	- If your structures are producing a lot of lag they can be deleted without warning or compensation.
	- No homebases on planets.

- Admins:
	- Please understand that admins are not usual players. They dont fight or grind, they try to fix issues and make sure that everyone has fun.
	- Admins do not participate in combat.
	- Do not attack admins or admin owned objects.
	- You can ask admins for help with technical problems.
	- Admins can judge a situation and make up/overrule rules if necessary. follow these rules. 
	- Admins will try to help you. But you do NOT have an inherent right to be immideately helped by an admin. 
	
- Public infrastructure:
 	- Do not try to damage or capture such infrastructure
	- includes admin provided infrastructure, f.e. warpgates and spawnstation (anything owned by "Eden Commerce Guild")
	- public infrastructure is not by default a safezone. combat is usually allowed here.

- Safe zones:
	- safe zones are pure PVE areas.
	- No fighting, no ambushing, no kidnapping, no pushing out ships, etc.
	- you are responsible for your AI fleets attacking safe zones too.

- Rules and Offenses:
	- If you break rules, you can be warned, muted, kicked, punished through gamemechanics, temporarily or permanently banned.
	- The punishment orients itself on the severity of the offense and how often you break rules.
	- if you are testing the limits of how far you can go, you can also be punished. Dont push the limits of the rules.
	- if you feel that you have been treated unfairly by an admin or moderator, contact another Admin in the SOE discord.
